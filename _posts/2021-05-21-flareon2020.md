# challenge 1

The first challenge is named fidler that appears to be a simple game written in python. Inside the archive was a folder with the following contents:

```
PS C:\Users\rev\Documents\flare2020\1_-_fidler> ls

```

I ran the `.exe` file to see what I was dealing with, but immediately ran into a roadblock: the game was asking for a password

Due to this roadblock, I turned my attention to the `.py` files.

## password recovery
Since I have the source code, I didn't really bother analyzing the `.exe` file that came with the archive: `controls.py` and `fidler.py`.

Opening `controls.py` and quickly skimming the file revealed that all this file was likely used for was to control input like mouse events, so this file was mostly ignored.

`fidler.py` showed one function that was very interesting upon opening it helpfully called `password_check(input)`:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def password_check(input):
    altered_key = 'hiptu'
    key = ''.join([chr(ord(x) - 1) for x in altered_key])
    return input == key
{% endhighlight %}

An encoded, hardcoded password was found here and a python command to do something to the password, I simply ran this code chunk in the terminal to get the output:

```
>>> altered_key = 'hiptu'
>>> key = ''.join([chr(ord(x) - 1) for x in altered_key])
>>> print(key)
ghost
```
Of course, if you understood that python line you probably wouldn't have had to run this in the command line at all. All this line is doing is shifting all of the letters in the string 'hiptu' back one letter to get the word 'ghost'.

## back to the game
I suspected that this was the password that the game was asking for upon opening it, so I entered the password 'ghost' and I was allowed to play the game:

![game screen](/assets/flare2020_c1_gamescreen.png)

The basic premise of the game is as follows: 
1. click on cat head to generate coins
2. buy autoclickers for 10 coins so you don't wear out your finger
3. eventually earn 100 billion coins
4. ???
5. profit

At least there are no microtransactions.

There is technically a win condition for the game, so if you were patient you could play the game until the win condition was met then get the flag for this challenge that way. However, that's boring so I went deeper into the python files.

## back to `fidler.py`
At this point, I figured out the password so I ignored the other functions which reference the password needed to start the game. I turned my attention to the `main()` function to see where the program actually started after the password screen:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def main():
    if password_screen():
        game_screen()
    else:
        password_fail_screen()
    pg.quit()
{% endhighlight %}

I saw here that if you successfully entered the password, it'd call the function called `game_screen()`, so that's where I went to next.

## meat and `game_screen()`
The beginning of this function is mostly the initialization of a lot of variables needed for the game's logic and displaying images and such. Skimming these variables didn't reveal anything useful, so I scrolled until I found non-boilerplate code:
{% highlight python linenos %}
    while not done:
        target_amount = (2**36) + (2**35)
        if current_coins > (target_amount - 2**20):
            while current_coins >= (target_amount + 2**20):
                current_coins -= 2**20
            victory_screen(int(current_coins / 10**8))
            return
        current_ticks = pg.time.get_ticks()
        passed_time = current_ticks - last_second
        if passed_time >= 1000:
            last_second = current_ticks
            current_coins += current_autoclickers
{% endhighlight %}

In this block I found the function `victory_screen(int(current_coins / 10**8))` interesting, so I decided to focus on that. However, in order to get to this function, some other conditions must be met. The number of coins you currently possess must be (2^36 + 2^35) - 2^20 <= current_coins <= (2^36 + 2^35) + 2^20, or 103,078,166,528 <= current_coins <= 103,080,263,680.
> For those unfamiliar with python, the syntax `x**y` means `x^y`

If your `current_coins` value is the magic value, it's then divided by 10^8 and the fraction is dropped due to the `int` conversion, so you're left with the value of 1030. Finally, the `victory_screen` function is called with the value of 1030: `victory_screen(1030)`.

## give me victory or give me `py`
Scrolling to the `victory_screen` function shows more boilerplate code at the beginning which begs to be ignored. However, hopefully your eyes didn't glaze over too much or you would've missed this function call: `flag_content_label.change_text(decode_flag(token))`

The variable `token` was a function parameter for `victory_screen(token)` which is currently holding the value 1030. Following the function call to `decode_flag(frob)` gives us some interesting code:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def decode_flag(frob):
    last_value = frob
    encoded_flag = [1135, 1038, 1126, 1028, 1117, 1071, 1094, 1077, 1121, 1087, 1110, 1092, 1072, 1095, 1090, 1027,
                    1127, 1040, 1137, 1030, 1127, 1099, 1062, 1101, 1123, 1027, 1136, 1054]
    decoded_flag = []

    for i in range(len(encoded_flag)):
        c = encoded_flag[i]
        val = (c - ((i%2)*1 + (i%3)*2)) ^ last_value
        decoded_flag.append(val)
        last_value = c

    return ''.join([chr(x) for x in decoded_flag])
{% endhighlight %}

Based on the earlier function, the `frob` variable contains 1030 which is then assigned to the `last_value` variable. Since the magic number is known, a simple copy/paste/modify job of this function into python will reveal the flag:
{% highlight python linenos %}
last_value = 1030 # changed frob to 1030
encoded_flag = [1135, 1038, 1126, 1028, 1117, 1071, 1094, 1077, 1121, 1087, 1110, 1092, 1072, 1095, 1090, 1027,
                1127, 1040, 1137, 1030, 1127, 1099, 1062, 1101, 1123, 1027, 1136, 1054]
decoded_flag = []

for i in range(len(encoded_flag)):
    c = encoded_flag[i]
    val = (c - ((i%2)*1 + (i%3)*2)) ^ last_value
    decoded_flag.append(val)
    last_value = c

print(''.join([chr(x) for x in decoded_flag]))

{% endhighlight %}

## takeaways
While this challenge wasn't too difficult, I did spin my wheels a bit by not paying attention to some details. I went straight to the `decode_flag` function after identifying the password and was met with some challenges when attempting to manually reverse the decoding. Taking a step back and looking at the function call stack a bit closer helped me identify what I was missing.

Flare-on challenge 2 involves a forensically recovered file that is in an unusable state. The goal here is to repair the file so it can be ran in order to retrieve the flag.

# challenge 2
## alignment and corruption
Since the file cannot be ran, I was stuck doing static analysis initially. I used [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388) to look a the file initially, and looking at the section headers revealed that the executable was packed by [UPX](https://upx.github.io/). 

![cff explorer with upx headers](/assets/flare2020c2-cff-explorer.png)

Attempting to unpack the binary was unsuccessful and UPX gave an error.
```
upx -d garbage.exe

   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
upx: garbage.exe: OverlayException: invalid overlay size; file is possibly corrupt

Unpacked 1 file: 0 ok, 1 error.
```

Since the challenge suggested the file was corrupt, this is not a big surprise but it was worth trying anyway. The next step is to look for a way to purify the file of its corruption.

I opted to use a tool called [PE-bear](https://hshrzd.wordpress.com/pe-bear/) to further analyze the file. PE-bear shows that there's an error with the `.rsrc` section of the binary and other issues in the optional header section. Clicking the align button in PE-bear shows that the raw size of the file is not what's expected by the binary, so you can accept the changes and then save a new copy of the binary to disk. After saving the file to the disk, UPX is able to unpack the file.

Unpacked 1 file.
```

However, the file still didn't want to run and causes an error to log out to Windows' event viewer. Opening the event viewer and looking for the error message for this application reveals the following message:
> Activation context generation failed for "C:\Users\rev\Documents\flare2020\2\_-\_garbage\garbage.exe".Error in manifest or policy file "C:\Users\rev\Documents\flare2020\2\_-\_garbage\garbage.exe" on line 3. Invalid Xml syntax.

New error messages means progress, right?

## a window and its resources
The error message references invalid XML syntax which seems odd considering that we're working with a binary file. The thing is, Windows executables usually include something called an [application manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests) which is an XML formatted file. With this information, I opened the unpacked file up in CFF Explorer again and opened the resources that are referenced in the binary. There's a folder called "configuration files" and something simply labeled "1 - \[lang:1033\]". Clicking on the file shows a broken XML file.

Since I don't know what the manifest was supposed to look like, I did what anyone else would do and deleted it to see what would happen. I wept when my deleting plan didn't work, but I got new error messages again so more progress was had.

## dlhell
The previous error shows missing DLLs, but like any good error message, it doesn't tell us what DLLs are actually missing. Navigating to the import directory shows that there are two DLLs that should be imported, but they aren't named. Luckily, clicking on the mystery libraries shows us functions related to said library. Off to the internet I went and searched for what libraries these functions were associated to and I found the first DLL was `kernel32.dll` and the second was `shell32.dll`.

I saved the my changes and then ran the executable again and I finally got the flag.

## takeaways
An interesting challenge that taught me a bit more about how to fix a forensically recovered file and a bit more about the PE header in practice.
