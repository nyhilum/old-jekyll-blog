One mistake that's often made is conflating privacy and anonymity and thinking having one implies the presence of the other. On the contrary, it's entirely possible to have one, but not the other. Most tools that advertise themselves as "privacy-focused" generally strive to provide the privacy piece of the equation, but may not do anything regarding anonymity. It's important to understand the difference between these concepts, and when a service offers only one, the other, or both. 

Let's start with some simple definitions:

- privacy: access to some information is limited 
- anonymity: the identity of the owner of some information is unknown 

Using these contrived definitions, we can construct some scenarios where it's possible to have one but not the other. 

# private, but not anonymous

Some people, strangely enough, will use their real name on social media. However, they may take extra steps in order to ensure the content they create will only go to specific people or groups of people.  For example, Twitter has a way to [protect your tweets](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets) which basically means that they're only available to your followers. After changing this setting, your tweets are, for our intents and purposes, private. However, remember that you're posting under your real name, so your tweets are not anonymous. 

Another example. In meatspace, you can send letters to people via mail. When sending a standard letter, you wrap your message in an envelope and write the recipient's address along with your return address on the envelope. Your message would be private, but again, not anonymous. 

# anonymous, but not private

Probably one of the more infamous examples of something being anonymous but not private is the Bitcoin blockchain. You don't need a full understanding of Bitcoin or blockchains work, but just know that Bitcoin uses a public ledger. This means that all transactions that occur on Bitcoin's blockchain are public record; however, the details of the transaction only include certain information like which wallet is sending the coins, and which wallet is receiving the coins. The wallets themselves are just a series of random alphanumeric characters with no real identifying information associated to them. Therefore, the transaction is considered anonymous since you do not know who is sending and who is receiving the coins. 

For a simpler example, imagine signing up for a social media account under a pseudonym. This pseudonym doesn't connect back to your real identity in any way. You decide to generate content under this pseudonym, but leave the post visibility set to public, so everyone can enjoy your hot takes on the arbitrary definition of a sandwich. In this case, you have achieved anonymity but not privacy; you're safe from Camp Hot Dog for another day.

# why this matters

A privacy granting service may not necessarily grant you anonymity and vice versa. In fact, most services do not guarantee anonymity at all. Anonymity is generally going to be the responsibility of the user rather than the service. If you sign up for a social media account under a pseudonym, but start posting personal information such as pictures of your city, you may not be anonymous for long. 

Likewise, if you're in a scenario where the government may compel a company to turn over its records on your pseudonym, you should not count on that company's privacy marketing to protect you. For example, ProtonMail was [required by the Swiss court](https://www.wired.com/story/protonmail-amends-policy-after-giving-up-activists-data/) to log an activist's IP address and collect their browser fingerprint. While it's true that ProtonMail wasn't able to provide the activist's emails because they were encrypted (private), they were able to log the IP address and turn that information over in an attempt to identify the activist (anonymity).
