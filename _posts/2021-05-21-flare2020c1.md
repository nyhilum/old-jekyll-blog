The first challenge is named fidler that appears to be a simple game written in python. Inside the archive was a folder with the following contents:

```

```

I ran the `.exe` file to see what I was dealing with, but immediately ran into a roadblock: the game was asking for a password

![password screen](../../assets/flare2020_c1_passscreen.png)

Due to this roadblock, I turned my attention to the `.py` files.

# password recovery
Since I have the source code, I didn't really bother analyzing the `.exe` file that came with the archive: `controls.py` and `fidler.py`.

Opening `controls.py` and quickly skimming the file revealed that all this file was likely used for was to control input like mouse events, so this file was mostly ignored.

`fidler.py` showed one function that was very interesting upon opening it helpfully called `password_check(input)`:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def password_check(input):
    altered_key = 'hiptu'
    key = ''.join([chr(ord(x) - 1) for x in altered_key])
    return input == key
{% endhighlight %}

An encoded, hardcoded password was found here and a python command to do something to the password, I simply ran this code chunk in the terminal to get the output:

```
>>> altered_key = 'hiptu'
>>> key = ''.join([chr(ord(x) - 1) for x in altered_key])
>>> print(key)
ghost
```
Of course, if you understood that python line you probably wouldn't have had to run this in the command line at all. All this line is doing is shifting all of the letters in the string 'hiptu' back one letter to get the word 'ghost'.

# back to the game
I suspected that this was the password that the game was asking for upon opening it, so I entered the password 'ghost' and I was allowed to play the game:

![game screen](../../assets/flare2020_c1_gamescreen.png)

The basic premise of the game is as follows: 
1. click on cat head to generate coins
2. buy autoclickers for 10 coins so you don't wear out your finger
3. eventually earn 100 billion coins
4. ???
5. profit

At least there are no microtransactions.

There is technically a win condition for the game, so if you were patient you could play the game until the win condition was met then get the flag for this challenge that way. However, that's boring so I went deeper into the python files.

# back to `fidler.py`
At this point, I figured out the password so I ignored the other functions which reference the password needed to start the game. I turned my attention to the `main()` function to see where the program actually started after the password screen:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def main():
    if password_screen():
        game_screen()
    else:
        password_fail_screen()
    pg.quit()
{% endhighlight %}

I saw here that if you successfully entered the password, it'd call the function called `game_screen()`, so that's where I went to next.

# meat and `game_screen()`
The beginning of this function is mostly the initialization of a lot of variables needed for the game's logic and displaying images and such. Skimming these variables didn't reveal anything useful, so I scrolled until I found non-boilerplate code:
{% highlight python linenos %}
    while not done:
        target_amount = (2**36) + (2**35)
        if current_coins > (target_amount - 2**20):
            while current_coins >= (target_amount + 2**20):
                current_coins -= 2**20
            victory_screen(int(current_coins / 10**8))
            return
        current_ticks = pg.time.get_ticks()
        passed_time = current_ticks - last_second
        if passed_time >= 1000:
            last_second = current_ticks
            current_coins += current_autoclickers
{% endhighlight %}

In this block I found the function `victory_screen(int(current_coins / 10**8))` interesting, so I decided to focus on that. However, in order to get to this function, some other conditions must be met. The number of coins you currently possess must be (2^36 + 2^35) - 2^20 <= current_coins <= (2^36 + 2^35) + 2^20, or 103,078,166,528 <= current_coins <= 103,080,263,680.
> For those unfamiliar with python, the syntax `x**y` means `x^y`

If your `current_coins` value is the magic value, it's then divided by 10^8 and the fraction is dropped due to the `int` conversion, so you're left with the value of 1030. Finally, the `victory_screen` function is called with the value of 1030: `victory_screen(1030)`.

# give me victory or give me `py`
Scrolling to the `victory_screen` function shows more boilerplate code at the beginning which begs to be ignored. However, hopefully your eyes didn't glaze over too much or you would've missed this function call: `flag_content_label.change_text(decode_flag(token))`

The variable `token` was a function parameter for `victory_screen(token)` which is currently holding the value 1030. Following the function call to `decode_flag(frob)` gives us some interesting code:
{% highlight python linenos %}
def decode_flag(frob):
    last_value = frob
    encoded_flag = [1135, 1038, 1126, 1028, 1117, 1071, 1094, 1077, 1121, 1087, 1110, 1092, 1072, 1095, 1090, 1027,
                    1127, 1040, 1137, 1030, 1127, 1099, 1062, 1101, 1123, 1027, 1136, 1054]
    decoded_flag = []

    for i in range(len(encoded_flag)):
        c = encoded_flag[i]
        val = (c - ((i%2)*1 + (i%3)*2)) ^ last_value
        decoded_flag.append(val)
        last_value = c

    return ''.join([chr(x) for x in decoded_flag])
{% endhighlight %}

Based on the earlier function, the `frob` variable contains 1030 which is then assigned to the `last_value` variable. Since the magic number is known, a simple copy/paste/modify job of this function into python will reveal the flag:
{% highlight python linenos %}
last_value = 1030 # changed frob to 1030
encoded_flag = [1135, 1038, 1126, 1028, 1117, 1071, 1094, 1077, 1121, 1087, 1110, 1092, 1072, 1095, 1090, 1027,
                1127, 1040, 1137, 1030, 1127, 1099, 1062, 1101, 1123, 1027, 1136, 1054]
decoded_flag = []

for i in range(len(encoded_flag)):
    c = encoded_flag[i]
    val = (c - ((i%2)*1 + (i%3)*2)) ^ last_value
    decoded_flag.append(val)
    last_value = c

print(''.join([chr(x) for x in decoded_flag]))

# takeaways
While this challenge wasn't too difficult, I did spin my wheels a bit by not paying attention to some details. I went straight to the `decode_flag` function after identifying the password and was met with some challenges when attempting to manually reverse the decoding. Taking a step back and looking at the function call stack a bit closer helped me identify what I was missing.
